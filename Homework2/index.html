                     I decided to enroll in the UT Bootcamp for Full-Stack Development because I have always been curious
                    about how
                    software worked, especially the web. As a Software Quality Engineer I had an idea, but was never
                    given
                    the opporrunity to study the code and the mystery behind why a button works when I clicked it. As a
                    tester I can verify if it works or not, but I want to be able to dig deeper when that same button
                    doesn't function the way I expect it
                    to.<br><br>I aim to learn the skills to become a full-stack developer in test. I found the work to be
                    both
                    enjoyable and challenging. Even when I felt like throwing my laptop against the nearest wall because
                    the code I
                    had written didn't work as expected. I contiuned on until I found my solultion and was able to clap
                    my hands
                    and yell out, "Yes!" once I hit the refresh button on my browser. Witnessing the results of a
                    working website after all of my tenactiy and hard work brings me so much joy.
                    My motivation not only comes from the desire to gain new employable skills, but to continue to be a
                    role model
                    for my children. I want them to see that we never stop learning and to always strive to be the best
                    version of
                    ourselves. I love the look on their faces when I say, "I have to do homework." It's a look of wonder
                    and respect and leaves them with no excuse on why they can't get theirs done because Mommy is also
                    working a full-time job. In my spare time I enjoy being with my family, watching movies, traveling,
                    singing and volunteering at my local church.
